I [switched to Vim](http://reyhan.org/2013/03/vim.html) because I was spending much of my time in a terminal. I've been using [Screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen) for many years, mainly for kinda persistant tasks (like [running a webcam](http://reyhan.org/2013/09/webcam-on-linux.html)) but found its performance a bit quirky.

These days I need something more scalable and robust so thought I'd bite the bullet and kick the tyres of [tmux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux). It's pretty sweet, [here is my starter config](https://github.com/rey/.tmux).

I'm not going to write my own instructions on how to tmux but here are a few links that I found helpful:

### Handy links I used to tmux

* [A tmux Crash Course](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course) by Josh Clayton
* [tmux is sweet as heck](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/03/21/tmux-is-sweet-as-heck) by Alex Munroe
* [tmux - terminal multiplexer](http://jasonwryan.com/blog/2010/01/07/tmux-terminal-multiplexer) by Jason Wryan

I'm also currently [experiencing a curious bug](http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports-bugs/2013-July/259557.html) where in Terminal.app on Mavericks:

> tmux 1.8 has a bug that causes it to unexpectedly underline all characters when the status bar requests a bold color.
