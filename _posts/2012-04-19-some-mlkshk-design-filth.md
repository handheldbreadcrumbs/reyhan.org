It's no secret that I adore [MLKSHK](http://mlkshk.com) â€” it's one of the things
that excites me on the interwho at the moment.

Here is one example of awesome.

This is the handy New Post panel that appears when you click the er, *New Post*
button. Naturally, you can click *Upload an image* to bring up a file browser
window where you can select an image to upload.

However, you can also drag an image to that panel and it'll upload! It's a
small, hidden cheeky bit of functionality but such is the design of MLKSHK, you
already know it's going to work before you do it.

Intuitive is defined as "*Using or based on what one feels to be true even
without conscious reasoning*". MLKSHK has fun, intuitive design in bucket loads.

Few websites/apps that I use these days have any sort of personality, which I
find sad.
