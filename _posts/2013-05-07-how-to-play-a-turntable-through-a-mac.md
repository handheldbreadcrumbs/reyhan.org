_This is a quick, easy and relatively cheap way to play a turntable through your Mac._

### Ingredients

1. Some flavour of turntable that has an RCA (line/phono) output. I have a [Numark TTUSB](http://www.numark.com/product/ttusb)
2. [Behringer U-CONTROL UCA202](http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/UCA202.aspx) USB audio interface
3. [LineIn](http://rogueamoeba.com/freebies) from Rogue Amoeba

### Instructions

1. Plug the RCA connector from the turntable into the UCA202's input
2. Plug the UCA202 into your Mac's USB port
3. Load up LineIn and set `Input from` to `USB Audio CODEC`
4. Set `Output to` to your speakers, for example `Built-in Output: Internal Speakers` or `HDMI: SAMSUNG` etc
5. Click the `Pass Thru` button and throw on [some filth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC3Cthm0HFU)
