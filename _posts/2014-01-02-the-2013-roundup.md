Following [Karl's 2013 roundup](http://karlfreeman.co.uk/articles/2013/the-2013-roundup.html) I thought I'd have a go at my own. This look longer than I expected.

### OS X Applications

The only new application here is Moom. I spend much of my time with a fair few windows open and Moon gives me an unobtrusive way to organise windows superquick. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.

I've been a user of the rest of the applications since their respective births and they do their jobs admirably.

* [Chrome Canary](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html) - for development and surfing the information super highway
* [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes) - for listening to my music
* [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom) - window manager
* [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com) - image editing
* [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com) - application launcher
* [Terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X) - where I spend most of my time
* [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac) - to share what I'm having for lunch
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc) - to watch all the videos

### Terminal Applications

I'm living in the terminal more than ever and have recently moved my instant messaging and email to the command line. I find it more efficient to jump between tmux windows and sessions than between different attention-grabbing applications. A side effect is that I'm using the mouse at lot less which is better for my wrists.

* [Irssi](http://www.irssi.org) - IRC client
* [Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) - operating system monitoring tool
* [MCabber](http://mcabber.com) - XMPP client
* [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org) - email client
* [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) - terminal multiplexer
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org) - the text editor of truth

### iOS Applications of note

Although I only have two pages of applications on my iPhone I didn't feel the need to list them all. Here are a small(ish) selection of ones that I use regularly and don't think I could do without.

* [Alien Blue](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/alien-blue-reddit-client/id370144106) - reddit client
* [Citymapper](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/citymapper-london-new-york/id469463298) - it really is the ultimate transport app
* [Foursquare](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/foursquare/id306934924) - the city is my playground
* [FuelBand](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nike+-fuelband/id493325070) - for the FuelBand
* [IFTTT](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ifttt/id660944635) - I'm using the [iOS Location Channel](https://ifttt.com/ios_location) a fair bit
* [Malt](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/malt/id513434229) - beautiful [MLKSHK](http://mlkshk.com) client
* [Prompt](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/prompt/id421507115?) - SSH client from [Panic](http://panic.com)
* [Reeder](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-2/id697846300) - the best feedreader app by far.
* [Simplenote](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/simplenote/id289429962) - for all my notes. Sync works wonderfully
* [Tumblr](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tumblr/id305343404)
* [Tweetbot](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tweetbot-2-iphone-ipod-touch/id428851691) - still haven't upgraded to Tweetbot 3
* [Weather Line](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/weather-line-accurate-forecast/id715319015) - pretty good weather app

### Hardware

* Dell box - an ancient Dell box that runs Debian
* [Filco Majestouch 2](http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard/uk-filco-majestouch-2-tenkeyless-nkr-click-action-keyboard.asp) - mechanical keyboard
* iPad mini
* iPhone 5
* Mac Mini - a media centre of sorts
* MacBook Pro (with Alkr cover) - my primary machine
* Raspberry Pi - I have two of these and love them for tinkering

### Online services

I'm hoping 2014 will be the year I ditch third party email providers and move to a self-hosted deal. I've considered different ways to do this but none have struck me as particularly future-proof or time efficient.

* [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) - I only use this for IFTTT tasks
* [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) - for bookmarks
* [Foursquare](http://foursquare.com) - for exploring the city
* [GitHub](http://github.com) - version control (and this blog!)
* [Gmail](http://gmail.com) - for email
* [iCloud](http://icloud.com) - for email, calendar and addressbook sync
* [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) - for gluing services together
* [MLKSHK](http://mlkshl.com) - [how about some f_cking whimsy?](http://torrez.org/how-about-some-fucking-whimsy.html)
* [SDF](http://sdf.org) - public access UNIX
* [Simplenote](http://simplenote.com) - syncs to clients on iPhone, iPad and Mac
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com) - photos of lunch and animals
