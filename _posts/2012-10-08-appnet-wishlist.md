_I've signed up to [App.net](http://app.net) because twttr is making some bad decisions. Here is a wish list which needs to be satisfied in order for App to work for me as a twttr-esque service &mdash; I appreciate the service is in Alpha._

### Major

* Private accounts - pretty self explanatory really. My [personal twttr](http://twitter.com/rey) is, of course, private.
* SMS. When I joined twttr in '06, the only way to post from your mobile telephone was [via text message](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#History). I'm still a heavy user of SMS posting and enjoy having a few follower's updates sent to me via text message.

### Minor

* An update should allow for 140 characters. Currently App has a 256 character limit. We're not writing novellas here people.
* Ability to customise your profile page (I'm thinking background image, text colours, yadda).
* Ability to block other users.

*[SMS]: Short Message Service
