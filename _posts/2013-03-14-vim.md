I usually use [Chocolat](http://www.chocolatapp.com) but find myself spending more time on remote machines where there isn't the luxury of a GUI so looked into a text editor with a bit more oomph than [Nano](http://www.nano-editor.org). Enter the rabbit hole that is [Vim](http://www.vim.org).

When googling around I was surprised and delighted by how much information there was about `[insert Vim topic here]`. I could write my own instructions for getting started but it would be a waste of time &mdash; other people have already done a much better job than I could. Have some links instead:

### Handy links I used to Vim

0. Ian Langworth's [Vim After 11 Years](http://statico.github.com/vim.html) &amp; Steve Losh's [Coming Home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim)
1. Addisu Z. Taddese's [Using Pathogen for your vim config files](http://addisu.taddese.com/blog/using-github-and-pathogen-for-your-vim-config-files/)
2. [Synchronizing plugins with git submodules and pathogen](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/) on Vimcasts

### Plugins that let me Vim

* [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) is a <q>Full path fuzzy file, buffer, mru, tag, ... finder for Vim.</q>. This replicates jump-to-any-file functionality that I love in Chocolat (and [TextMate](http://macromates.com) before it).
* [Powerline for vim](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) <q>is a utility plugin which allows you to create better-looking, more functional vim statuslines</q>. I need my line/columns counter.
