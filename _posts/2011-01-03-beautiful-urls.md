[Jim Ray links](http://jimray.tumblr.com/post/2584553426/designing-good-urls) to a good post by [Kyle Neath about URL design](http://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/) (emphasis mine):

> **Any regular semi-technical user of your site should be able to

A thousand times yes. I'm reminded of [Simon Willison's notes on a talk Tom Coates gave in 2006](http://simonwillison.net/notes/2006/summit/coates.txt) which are still massively valid[^1] (emphasis mine):

> Good URLs should:
>
> -   be permanent references to resources
> -   have a 1-to-1 correlation with concepts
> -   use directories to represent hierarchy (e.g. subordinate parts)
> -   NOT reflect the underlying technology - especially if it might change
> -   reflect the structure of the data
> -   be predictable/guessable/hackable
> -   be as human readable as possible
>
> **Good URLs are beautiful and a mark of design quality**

Furthermore, a page's `<title>` should be *a reply* to it's URL.
