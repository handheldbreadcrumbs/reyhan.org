_A random collection of handy tools that I've used at one point or another._

[ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com) &mdash; ImageOptim optimizes images — so they take up less disk space and load faster — by finding best compression parameters and by removing unnecessary comments and color profiles. It handles PNG, JPEG and GIF animations.

[T](http://sferik.github.com/t/) &mdash; A command-line power tool for Twitter.

[Google Refine](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/) &mdash; A power tool for working with messy data (formerly Freebase Gridworks)
